## Hi! I'm Linkai.
📍 md & wi | 🏫 [@uwmadison](https://wisc.edu) '27 | 🎓 [mbhs](https://mbhs.edu) '23

I'm a maker, programmer, and student! My work so far has mostly been in <span className="text-theme-primaryVariant font-medium">fullstack web dev</span>, but I'm currently exploring <span className="text-theme-primaryVariant font-medium">3D modeling</span> and <span className="text-theme-primaryVariant font-medium">game design</span>. I'm also currently a CS student at the University of Wisconsin.
