### I'm a maker, designer, and student.
CS & tech has been a passion of mine since grade school. My work is mostly in <span className="text-theme-primaryVariant font-medium">fullstack web dev</span>, but I'm currently exploring <span className="text-theme-primaryVariant font-medium">3D modeling</span> and <span className="text-theme-primaryVariant font-medium">3D printing</span>. I'm a rising freshman at UW-Madison with an intended major of CS.
